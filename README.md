To use this program, you will need to have Java 1.8 or later installed on your PC.
Open the program by double clicking parse_eqv3.jar
If you are using Linux, run the command:
 java -jar ./parse_eqv.jar

1. Open the original and translation .txt files.
!!!Both files should be saved with UTF-8 encoding!!! 
Both files should be aligned: they should contain
the same number of lines. The lines of the same number in both files should contain mutually
equivalent snippets.
2. Choose the correct language in the drop-out lists for the original and translation files.
3. If you want to perform previous analysis to enrich the database with more equivalents
used to split sentences, choose the checkbox "Previous analysis".
4. If you want to extract as many as the possible combination of phrases, unchoose the checkbox
"For human user". If you do choose this option, only not overlapping phrases will be extracted.
5. See the results. If you do not feel satisfied with the result, you can tune more options such as equivalent maximum length and the filter coefficient. The latter is used to rule out the equivalents whose length difference overpasses this threshold; although, the threshold
of 1.4 has proved to yield the best results so far".
